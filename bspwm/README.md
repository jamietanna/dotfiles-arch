# BSPWM

bspwm is a tiling window manager that I use over a more conventional Desktop Environment such as KDE, as it provides me with more control and speed to perform tasks.

## Dependencies

- Please also note that bspwm utilises `sxhkd`, as a lightweight wm-independent keybinding daemon, which is installed alongside bspwm in the above wiki page. My configs are avaiable in this repo. 
- If you wish to check battery status, you will need `acpi` installed via the official repository.
- Please also note that I am using `bar-aint-recursive`.

## Setup

To set up bspwm, please follow the instructions in the [Arch Wiki - bspwm](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Bspwm).
